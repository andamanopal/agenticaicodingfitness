# App 7 · NeMo Guardrails + OpenShell — securing sovereign agents

**Agent = Model + Harness.** This app is the **guardrail / runtime-security** layer:
how to SECURE a long-running sovereign agent that lives for days on your DGX with
tools, memory, and network. Three layers of defense:

- **NeMo Guardrails** — programmable rails around the LLM: **input** rails (jailbreak /
  prompt-injection), **topic/dialog** rails, **output** rails (no secrets/PII).
  Controls *what the model says*.
- **OpenShell Secure Runtime** — a hardened sandbox for agent tool-use with a network
  **egress allowlist** and a **signed, versioned policy** enforced by the **NemoClaw**
  gateway. Controls *what the tools can do*.
- **Privacy router** — routes PII/secrets to a **LOCAL sovereign NIM** (never leaves the
  perimeter); non-sensitive traffic may use a larger model. Controls *where data goes*.

Runs **dual-mode**: **REAL** against a local NIM / Ollama / vLLM OpenAI endpoint, or
**SIM** with no GPU (`week20/07_guardrails_openshell/sim.py`).

## Run the web tutorial

```bash
cd week20/guardrails_openshell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tutorial_server.py            # → http://localhost:8106
```

Open **http://localhost:8106**. Use **🔌 Connection** to point at your DGX
(`http://<dgx>:8000/v1`) or leave it in SIM. Pick a model with the model picker.

## Run the chapters standalone

```bash
python demos/step01_threat_model.py      # why guard a long-running agent (threat model)
python demos/step02_author_rails.py      # NeMo Guardrails — author & test rails (ALLOW/BLOCK)
python demos/step03_secure_runtime.py    # OpenShell — sandbox + egress allowlist + signed policy
python demos/step04_privacy_router.py    # privacy router — keep PII on a LOCAL NIM
```
